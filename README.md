## 📊 Project Objective

- Evaluate impact of 5G rollout on business KPIs: Revenue, TAU, ARPU, and TUsU.
- Identify underperforming and high-performing plans.
- Discover regional (city-wise) performance patterns.
- Highlight cases where % change can mislead without base context.
- Provide data-backed business recommendations.

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – for data modeling, DAX, and dashboard design  
- **Excel** – for data preprocessing and exploration  
- **DAX** – for KPI calculations  
- **PowerPoint + Voice-over Video** – for stakeholder presentation  

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- 📉 Revenue dropped only **0.5%**, but **market share fell by 5.8%** — competitors grew faster.
- 📈 **ARPU increased by 11%**, but **TAU dropped by 7 million** — business depends on fewer high-paying users.
- 🔁 **Plan 11**, launched post-5G, became the **second highest revenue contributor**.
- ❌ Older **Plans 5, 6, and 7** dropped significantly in revenue (Plan 7 dropped ~72%).
- ⚠️ **% change can mislead** — e.g., Lucknow showed 77% churn growth but only ~130K users affected.
- 🌆 **Delhi & Mumbai** showed strong ARPU growth; **Ahmedabad & Chennai** need targeted retention.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project taught me how to analyze user metrics like TAU, ARPU, and churn in real business scenarios.  
It also helped me think beyond visuals — interpreting % changes in context, understanding market share movement, and telling a clear story that leads to decision-making.
